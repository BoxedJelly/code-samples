Code samples

A small sampling of  each language I have spent at least a semester on.

RayTracer(C#)- A C# API for the domain specific language, visual POV Ray. I added the light class. This class was a good exersize in C#. I had to be signed into this class (Visual programming in C sharp) by my proffesor/advisor because I didn't meet the prerequisites. It was my first year of programming so many of the concepts were A little heavy to learn while learning a new language and advanced programming methods but I did successfully make my own neural net and Ray tracer from scratch (not this ray-tracer), and Conway's Life Game which was fun.

Parser (Java)- A comparitively plain grammer tree arithmetic calculator. However, it does run a pretty wide gamut of Java programming concepts like class factories and of-course interfaces and abstract classes. It also involves some nasty (I think) tree recursion.

Cartoon Sales(Web-Design)- This was my first web-design class. This assignment was a little vague so I went overbaord trying to make it very scalable and usable by others with the implementation of many atomic or atomic-like functions. For a look at what we're doing in Web Development 2 you can look at https://github.com/WSCU/vtour. It's conceptually not that impressive considering it's a class project but I learned a lot about pulling from open-source projects and implementing already-made solutions that way. Their is some Node 

Functional Graphics(Python)- A practice in Python. This assignment was loathed by us students. There is too much exact math that is really hard to debug. Luckily we have coding night and our Proffesor has been doing this assignment for maybe a decade so he helped up us through that. It is in my coding examples just to show some of the python things Ive used like functional abstractions and operator overloading both of which he gave us but I did some operator overloading myself in the assignment before.
