Code samples
I added a little something from each of my most educational coding classes.

RayTracer- A reactive engine class project in C#. I added the light class. This class was a good exersize in C#. I was signed into this class because I didn't meet the prerequisites. It was my first year of programming so many of the concepts were pretty hard to grasp but I did successfully make my own neural net, Ray tracer from scratch (not this ray-tracer), and Conway's Life Game.

Parser- A comparitively plain grammer tree calculator. However, it does run a pretty wide gamut of Java programming concepts like class factories and ofcourse interfaces and abstract classes. It also involves some nasty (I think) tree recursion.

Cartoon Sales- This was my first web-design class. This assignment was a little vague so I went overbaord trying to make it very scalable and usable by other with implementation of many atomic or atomic-like classes. For a look at what were doing in Web Development 2 you can look at https://github.com/WSCU/vtour. It's conceptually not that impressive considering it's a class project but I learned a lot about pulling from open-source projects and implementing already-made solutions that way.

Functional Graphics- This assignment was loathed by us students. There is too much exact math that is really hard to debug. Luckily we have coding night and our Proffesor has been doing this assignment for maybe a decade so he helped up us through that. It is in here just to show some of the python things Ive used like functional abstractions and operator overloading both of which he gave us but I did some operator overloading myself in the assignment before.
